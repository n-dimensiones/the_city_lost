 It leaves you free and full access to the first video game or 3D demo, "the lost city" as a powerful example of an app for the web,
 that only needs the web browser of any device, of code free made
 with the 3d engine or "blend4web" framework in javascript, html5 and css3, and the current state of development using only blender, gimp and audacity and notepad ++, has no
 nothing to envy to genres of video games as shooters, puzzle, simulation, adventures ... etc of other engines that are generated as native app and require for its access to specific high-end equipment.

Its simplicity and fast implementation, clearly differentiates it for
be ideal to start in 3d developments, learning and this development, just need to support it in its crowdfounding
 to get beyond it to be a multiplayer online game and without limits more than the hardware and that we are imposed by web browsers
that luckily is improving day by day.
 With your support, even higher resolution versions can be released for the enjoyment of high-end equipment.
While the support is missing, you can use this code, the binaries provided in dir assets of
 the meshes but they will be sure there are errors of not found of their images that will suppose a stick when testing it,
 but in the face of such scolding that I already make you more stick is to dedicate time to a project without this support.

Forecasts
-----------------
Of having the crowfounding support could do
 the videotutorials, the you to explain in an organized way the already existing modules, starting with an access to the scene and little by little in the rest of the tutorials go interacting with the scene and managing gamepad and keyboard and touch, pick up objects , strike, shoot, take damage, save state game, ..etc A complete content for beginners.
And the goal is to expand it with more effects thanks to the systems of particles, make more levels and improve the current levels with all the current deficiencies that do not prevent its functionality that every videogame developer wants. Remember to support the crowdfounding so that together we can achieve it.

Crowdfounding campaign to continue developing:
----------------------------------------------------------------
I support it so that there are next outputs: multiplayer, middle and high resolution
https://patreon.com/ndimensiones
from $ 1 or € 1

version
-------
 current: 001

It is required to download sdk free CE 17.12 or the LITE or just the addon of blend4web to use it in blender 2.79.
  And only then you can get your own models and keep the names in the used code of the meshes and scenes .json and .bin files
It was updated to the current sdk18.05 because both 17 and 18 already use nodejs modules with javascript ES6, instead of the previous b4w.js api but
Since there were errors that can not be resolved, I kept the previous one so that it arrives in September if it had not been delayed.
and I do not have the time or money to allow it. If as I said you support crowdfounding, I insist again surely if I would deliver it updated to sdk1 18.05
with javascript ES6
